## Abstract

The central objective of this project is the development of an Intellectual
Property (IP) for a processor based on the RISC-V architecture for aerospace
applications. The processor must ensure its reliability for use in aerospace
environments through tests of the individual elements developed in VHDL, as well
as tests of the CPU as a whole. The project followed a bottom-up methodology,
initially focusing on component implementation, and gradually transitioning to
component integration as the project progressed. A Kanban board on GitHub was
used to guide the project, with tasks assigned to responsible individuals and
reviewers. Whenever there is an update to the codebase, an automated validation
test sequence is performed in the cloud using GitHub Actions. Additionally,
there is documentation and project references available as supporting material
on an online page.
