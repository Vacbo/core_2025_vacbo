## About

<p>This project's objective is to develop a RISC-V processor for aerospatial applications, while guaranteeing it’s trustworthiness through a CI/CD pipeline, which is an automation practice where the development process is divided in steps.</p>

<p>The institution "Insper Instituto de Ensino e Pesquisa", also known as Insper, is a non-profitable organization dedicated to research and teaching, and this project was developed by three of it's students as a final project for the computer engineering course, working together with the brazilian government organization "Centro de Tecnologia da Informação Renato Archer", also known as CTI Renato Archer.</p>

## Project Overview

The project was divided into two branches ofdevelopment: the development of individual components, which are tested by cocotb, and the development of the CPU, which is tested in the FPGA board
