# RISC-V Development for Aerospace Applications

![](/public/images/capa_ilustrativa.jpg)  

## Introduction

The Final Engineering Project (PFE) is a mandatory course for eighth-semester
students in the engineering striving for graduation at Insper Institute of 
Education and Research. In partnership with the Renato Archer Information 
Technology Center (CTI), a research unit of the Ministry of Science, Technology, 
and Innovation of the Federal Executive Branch of Brazil, the implementation 
of a microcontroller with a RISC-V architecture-based processing core for use 
in national aerospace projects was proposed as a PFE.

Saulo Finco is the coordinator responsible for the project at CTI, and Rafael 
Corsi is the guiding professor at Insper. The activities were conducted throughout
the first semester of 2024.

## Summary

The objective of this project is to develop a RISC-V processor for aerospace 
applications, ensuring its quality through a CI/CD pipeline, which is an 
automation practice where the development process is divided into stages.
